The pineapple-shaped fruits are borne on female trees whereas the spikes of fragrant, pollenbearing flowers are borne separately on male trees. Many uses: leaves (lau hala) for mats, baskets, hats; the yellow to red fruit sections for leis, brushes; male flowers to scent tapa, their leaflike bracts to plait mats 
(see hīnano). (Neal 51.) The aerial root (uleule) tip is a good source of vitamin B and cooked in ti leaves was used medicinally, although unpleasant tasting. The tree is called pū hala.

The bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria, also L. vulgaris), a wide-spreading vine, with large-angled or lobed leaves, white, night blooming flowers, and smooth green and mottled or white fruits varying widely in shape and size. The plant is a native of tropical Asia or Africa. Hawaiians have long used gourds as receptacles, small gourds with thin walls to hold water or food, or for rattles for dances (the ipu has a fine tone, halfway between that of niu and laʻamia), larger ones with thin to thick walls to hold tapa and other articles or to serve as drums. Orientals cook and eat the white pulp of green fruits. Hawaiians have distinguished between a kind with bitter pulp, used medicinally, and a kind with nonbitter pulp. (Neal 812–3.) For gourds classified according to shape and color see hōkeo, hue, hulilau, kūkaeʻiwa, ʻolo, poʻokanaka. Cf. pule ipu.

Among many varieties that were developed were three outstanding ones: ipu huluhulu, ipu poʻo kanaka, and ipu oloolo. Today watermelons are again cultivated successfully because the fruits are commonly wrapped in paper or cloth during early stages. (Neal 810–1.) Also ipu ʻai maka, ipu ʻai waha, ipu haole.
